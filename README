Plugin for adding the NC State Branding Bar to the top of your Wordpress
website.  This plugin has been tested in Wordpress 3.x.

When downloading the source directly from GitHub, you will need to extract it
into a folder, zip it, and then upload it to your Wordpress installation.  To
avoid doing that, just download one of the versioned releases and then upload
it directly.

This plugin was created by the Office of Information Technology, Outreach
Technology.
