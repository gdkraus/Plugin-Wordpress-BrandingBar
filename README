Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1:  Download the latest release (not actual project code) from the github page
    located at:
    http://github.com/ncsuwebdev/Plugin-Wordpress-BrandingBar

2:  Extract folder "ncstate-branding-bar" into your Wordpress plugin
    directory, typically located in /wp-content/plugins.  If your Wordpress
    installation allows plugins to be installed via a zip file, you can do that
    as well by clicking on "Plugins" -> "Add New" -> "Upload" and upload the
    zip file."

    NOTE:  This only works if you download the pre-packaged zip file from
    github.  If you download the source directly, uploading that zip file will
    not work correctly.  Essentially, you need to ensure that the
    /wp-content/plugins/ncstate-branding-bar directory exists and put the
    contents of the download in the folder.

3:  Log into the admin section of your Wordpress site, typically at
    http://[yoururl]/wp-admin

4:  Click on "Plugins."

5:  You should have a plugin called "NC State Branding Bar" in your
    plugin list.  Click the "Activate" link under it.

6:  Configuration can be done to the branding bar by visiting the link in the
    "Settings" admin menu.
